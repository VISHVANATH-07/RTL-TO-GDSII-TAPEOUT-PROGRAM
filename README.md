# RTL-TO-GDSII-TAPEOUT-PROGRAM
This 20-week program provides a complete demonstration of the tapeout cycle for a RISC-V Reference SoC using Synopsys tools and the SCL180 nm PDK. It offers participants an end-to-end experience of the VLSI design flow, beginning from RTL design and extending through GDSII generation to post-silicon validation.
